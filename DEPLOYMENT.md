## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Go to github.com and create a new repository named "northpoint-legal-tech"
# Then run these commands:

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/northpoint-legal-tech.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to netlify.com
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect to your GitHub repository
4. Netlify will auto-detect the `netlify.toml` configuration
5. Deploy will automatically trigger on main branch pushes

### 3. Deploy to Railway
1. Go to railway.app
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your repository
5. Railway will auto-detect the Node.js project
6. Add environment variables in Railway dashboard
7. Deploy will automatically trigger on main branch pushes

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Set these in Railway dashboard for production:
- All API keys and credentials
- Database connection details
- GSC service account key (base64 encoded)

## ðŸš€ Auto-Deployment
Both Netlify and Railway are configured for auto-deployment:
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch
- **Frontend**: Builds and deploys to Netlify CDN
- **Backend**: Deploys and runs on Railway servers
- **Zero-downtime**: Both platforms support rolling deployments
