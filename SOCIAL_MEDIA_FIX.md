# Twitter/X Social Media Generation - FIXED ✅

## Issue Resolved
The Twitter/X social media generation issue has been **completely fixed**. The problem was a parameter mismatch between the frontend and backend API.

## What Was Wrong
- **Frontend** (`SocialMediaLab.tsx`) was sending `topic` parameter
- **Backend API** (`routesSocial.ts`) was expecting `prompt` parameter
- This caused the API to return: "Prompt is required and must be a string"

## Fix Applied
✅ **Frontend Fixed**: Updated `SocialMediaLab.tsx` to send `prompt` instead of `topic`
