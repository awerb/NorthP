# Netlify SPA Routing Fix - Deployment Issue Resolved

## Problem
- Sub-pages showing "Page not found" error on Netlify deployment
- URL like `/ai-visibility-checker` returning 404 errors
- React Router working locally but not on deployed site

## Root Cause
- Netlify was trying to serve static files for routes like `/ai-visibility-checker`
- Single Page Applications (SPAs) need server-side redirects to handle client-side routing
- Missing SPA redirect configuration for Netlify

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created `_redirects` file
**File:** `apps/web/public/_redirects`
```
/*    /index.html   200
```
- Redirects all routes to index.html with 200 status (not 301/302)
- Allows React Router to handle routing client-side

### 2. Updated `netlify.toml` configuration
**File:** `netlify.toml`
```toml
[[redirects]]
from = "/*"
to = "/index.html"
status = 200
```
- Added fallback redirect configuration
- Ensures all unmatched routes serve the React app

### 3. Verified React Router Configuration
- ✅ BrowserRouter properly configured in App.tsx
- ✅ All routes defined correctly:
  - `/` → Dashboard
  - `/social-media-lab` → Social Media Lab
  - `/news-radar` → News Radar
  - `/referral-nurture` → Referral Nurture
  - `/ai-visibility-checker` → AI Visibility Checker
  - `/keyword-monitor` → Keyword Monitor
  - `/union-strong` → Union Strong
  - `/creative-playground` → Creative Playground

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Changes committed to git
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub (commit: 5a0a3b6)
- ✅ Netlify auto-deployment triggered
- ⏳ Waiting for Netlify build to complete

## Expected Result
After Netlify finishes building (usually 2-3 minutes):
- All sub-pages will work correctly on the deployed site
- Direct URL access to routes like `/ai-visibility-checker` will work
- Navigation between pages will function properly
- No more "Page not found" errors

## Technical Notes
- This is a common issue with SPAs deployed to static hosting
- The `_redirects` file is processed during Netlify build
- Both `_redirects` and `netlify.toml` redirects provide redundancy
- Local development already worked because Vite dev server handles SPA routing automatically

## Verification Steps
1. Wait for Netlify deployment to complete
2. Visit https://northpointtools.netlify.app/ai-visibility-checker
3. Verify page loads correctly instead of showing 404
4. Test navigation between different sub-pages
5. Test direct URL access to any route

All sub-pages should now be fully functional on the deployed Netlify site!
